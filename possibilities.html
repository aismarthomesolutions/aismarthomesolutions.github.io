                <p>
			
As the air ducts were not well designed, there can be almost a ten degree difference between the first and second floor. I always hated having to adjust the thermostat depending on where I spent my time. Now my home knows what room I'm in and adjusts the temperature accordingly.

                <p>
			I'm getting to that age where it's a pain to do everything, literally. Anything that involves my joints now require serious consideration, even trivial tasks like getting the lights. Now I don't have to live in darkness, I can just tell my home what lights I want on or off, if I want it hotter or colder, what channel to watch; without ever leaving my seat.

                <p> 
			
Having always been a sci-fi geek, I dreamt of the day I can just say what I want and my command would be answered. Being able to control everything with my phone is cool but having to reach for it every time is a hassle, especially when it's in another room. Now, it doesnt matter what room I'm in or where my phone is, I just speak my wishes and it happens!

                <p>
			I'm what you might consider an online shopaholic so my doorstep tends to collect quite a few packages throughout the day while I'm out. 
			Recently, my packages have gone missing despite UPS tracking showing it was delivered. Oddly enough, after cameras were installed, I started receiving all my packages again.

                <h3>Differing Preferences</h3>
                <p> 
			
My room mate is half polar bear so he tends to prefer temperatures compareable to the north pole. Fortunately for me, we work different shifts so there isn't too much overlap when we're both home. So while most homes can just "set it and forget it" we're constantly turning the thermostat up and down. But now that our condo is smart, it knows exactly who is home and automatically adjusts the thermostat to fit our individual preferences.

                <p>
			Finding the remotes are hard enough as it is but with all the consoles that use the TV: blu-ray, Playstation, A/V receiver, AppleTV, I can never remember which HDMI is which on the TV. Now I just say "Turn on the blu-ray". No remembering anything, no looking for remotes, I should have had this installed ages ago!

                <p> 
			My favorite feature about my car is probably the push to start and keyless entry. 
			Even though its only a minor convenience, not having to dig for keys has added significant value to my life. Now I have the same convenience with my house. 
			Gone are the days of scrambling around the house wondering where I placed the keys when I'm already late!

                <h3>Sneaking Out</h3>
                <p>
			
Having caught my daughter sneaking out late at night, I been scratching my head on an effective way to keep tabs on her, afterall I can't check when I'm asleep. Thanks to the contact & motion sensors, I now get a notification on my phone if any of the doors are opened at night. On top of that, her phone serves as a "presence sensor" which shows me the exact time she comes & goes, and that is something she would never leave the house without.

I'm one of those people with to-do's constantly popping up in my head, especially at the most inconvenient times like when I'm cooking or carrying a ton of groceries. Now whenever something pops into my head, I just tell  Google to add it to the list. No more wondering what I have forgotten throughout the day!

                <p>
			
Since I am always on the road and never know when I'm going to be home, my options are either coming home to a furnace in the Vegas heat or leave the AC running and pay astronomical utility bills. Now I can turn the AC down right before my flight so its a nice cool 72 degrees by the time I get home. Only paying for what I use, who can say no to that?

                <p> 
			
I have the most inquisitive little boy ever and his questions are starting to become so random & widespread, I just don't have all the answers anymore. Now he can just ask Google directly, since that's what I would have done anyway. The best part? Google doesn't get worn down!

                <h3>Always the Perfect Temperature</h3>
                <p>
			
I sleep best around 62 degrees but it's the easiest to wake up around 74 degrees. As my body gets going and warms up, I like it around 70 degrees but after the sun sets, I like it around 76 degrees. In the old days, I would be adjusting the temperature every hour (yes I may have a minor case of OCD). Now my thermostat automatically adjusts depending on the time of day and whether I'm home or not. Best of all, it can gradually rise from 62 to 74 degrees when I'm sleeping which previously was not an option...since I don't sleepwalk.

My kids are always running in-and-out the house but constantly forgetting to close the door behind them. I got tired of yelling at them so now if the door stays open for more than five minutes, they get a friendly notification every minute it remains open.

                <p>
			
			
I've been noticing questionable characters wandering around our neighborhood so I had cameras installed but soon realized it wasn't a realistic solution since I just don't have the time to constantly monitor the cameras. Per Smart Home Solutions consultation, they set up motion sensors around the perimeter of my home so now I get a notification the second any unusual activity is detected in which case, I can then check my cameras. So far I haven't had to alert the authorities yet but all the sensors and cameras probably make my home an unappealing target.
